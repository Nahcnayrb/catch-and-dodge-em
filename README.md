## Catch and Dodge 'em
##### By: Bryan Chan and Jason Nguyen

**Introduction:** 

Have you ever been so bored that you're willing to play anything at all? Like maybe even a game
that is really mediocre and not at all at the caliber of top-tier games like League of Legends
and Valorant? Boy, do we have the perfect below-average game for you! These games that we have created
are simple and it even sounds quite a lot like cat and dog :). Read on to learn more about the game
and the project!

**Features of the Application:**
- In this application, users will be allowed to play between two different game modes: 
Catch 'em and Dodge 'em.

- Users will move using the arrow keys (up,down,left,right) to control the ball catcher

- In the game mode, Catch 'em, users must 'catch' the right-moving, red balls before they reach the right side of the screen, and end the game! However, if you catch all the red balls on the screen before any one of them reaches the right side, you win the round and advance to the next level. Poggers! The more you collect and complete the levels, the faster the red balls are going to move. Wow!

- In the game mode, Dodge 'em, users must 'dodge' the right-moving red balls. If one red ball touches you, the game is over. However, if all red balls reach the right side without touching your catcher, you win the level and advance to the next level. As you complete more levels, the speed of the red balls increase! Be fast!

**Inspiration:**

This is our first ever project/hackathon so we've decided to keep things simple. We both enjoy
playing video games so what better way to share our passion than to create our own!
