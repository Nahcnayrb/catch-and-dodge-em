## Catch and Dodge 'em
##### By: Bryan Chan and Jason Nguyen

**Pitch:** 

Have you ever been so bored that you're willing to play anything at all? Like maybe even a game
that is really mediocre and not at all at the caliber of top-tier games like League of Legends
and Valorant? Boy, do we have the perfect decent-ish game for you! These games that we have created
are simple and it even sounds quite a lot like cat and dog :). Read on to learn more about the game
and the project!

**Features of the Application:**
- In this application, users will be allowed to play between two different game modes: 
Catch 'em and Dodge 'em. 

- In the game mode, Catch 'em, users must 'catch' the right-moving, red balls before they reach 
the right side of the screen, and ends the game! The more you collect and complete the levels, the
harder the game becomes!

- In the game mode, Dodge 'em, users must 'dodge' the right-moving red balls. If one red ball
touches you, the game is over. As you complete more levels, the speed of the red balls increase!
Be fast!

**Inspiration:**

This is our first ever project/hackathon so we've decided to keep things simple. We both enjoy
playing video games so what better way to share our passion than to create our own!
